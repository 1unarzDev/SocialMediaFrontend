                  <p>I don’t get it. I just woke up in the middle of Mirkwood, dripping with a dark liquid. After the crew got up and started walking, I pinched myself, hoping that I would wake from a horrible dream—nothing happened!</p>

                  <p>The rest of the crew told me I’ve been looking “nice and petite lately.” Not sure what that’s supposed to mean…starvation has taken a toll on all of us. Oh, the things I would do to have a nice pork pie and escape this wretched goblin cave.</p>

                  <p>Coming along on this journey has finally enabled me to realize the drawbacks of being fat. Today, in an act of desperation, we tried to approach a band of wood elves in the forest, having a splendid feast. The lights went out with a “whoosh,” and we were left in total darkness! Afterward, these great big spiders picked us out one by one, bundling us up and pinching us to make us taste more tender. Every last spider approached me, eyeing me with a disgusting expression of hunger. I can only imagine what would have happened if Bilbo hadn’t been there to save us again.</p>

                    All these tricky riddles. I can’t stand them. I must remember these for the future. Taller than trees, yet never grows. I quite like this one:
                    “What has roots as nobody sees, /  Is taller than trees, / Up, up it goes, / And yet never grows?”

                  <p>
                    I answered it anyway, but I don’t have anywhere close to thirty teeth! That hobbit is always being tricky.
                    “Thirty white horses on a red hill, /  First they champ, / Then they stamp, / Then they stand still.”

                    From my time outside of the cave, I have learned many riddles. This one always stumps people!
                    “Voiceless it cries, / Wingless flutters, / Toothless bites, / Mouthless mutters.”

                  <p>
                    I commend Bilbo for his creativity. Such an elegant yet coherent riddle is hard to come by.
                    “An eye in a blue face / Saw an eye in a green face. / ‘That eye is like to this eye’ / Said the first eye, / ‘But in low place / Not in high place.’”

                  <p>
                    I know much of darkness, but Bilbo must not. He almost didn’t get the answer!
                    “It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, / Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. / It lies behind stars and under hills, / And empty holes it fills. / It comes first and follows after, / Ends life, kills laughter.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Who does Bilbo think I am? The plainness of this riddle is insulting.
                    “A box without hinges, key, or lid, / Yet golden treasure inside is hid.”

                    My yummy fish…I could have had something different today, but I lost that nasty hobbit and my present.
                    “Alive without breath, / As cold as death; / Never thirsty, ever drinking, / All in mail never clinking.”

                    A fish, table, man, three-legged stool, and cat? This is five questions! Not one!
                    “No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some.”

                    He got lucky! He was asking for more time! I know it.
                    “This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; / Gnaws iron, bites steel; / Grinds hard stones to meal; / Slays king, ruins town, / And beats high mountain down.”

                    He had it in his pocket the whole time! My present.

                    He stole it! That dirty hobbit thief! My present. It can’t be. I need to get it back. This is my warning to you, foul hobbit.

                  <p>Sadly, I have to leave the company behind as they enter Mirkwood. There is urgent business down south that can’t wait. I foresee many difficult trials for them, but I have faith in their ability to finish the journey.

Despite trolls nearly eating you, goblins capturing and trapping you, wargs chasing you up trees, spiders bundling you up, and elves ambushing and imprisoning you, you persevered and finished the journey. Well done.</p>

                  <p>The goblins’ fear of Glamdring and Orcrist is immense. The lord of the orcs dies from a single strike, unprotected by his servants. I knew of this fear initially, but had I known it was so intense, I would have taken action far sooner.</p>
